***WARNING*** When any contents of __ui_project_name__ are modified, it and its contents need to be manually zipped into a file named esp-lcd-3-5-diy.zip in the esp-lcd-3-5-diy_vn_n_n directory. When the version of the esp-lcd-3-5-diy board support package changes, a new directory must be created incorporating the updated version number.
