# SquareLine Studio Custom Board

[Custom Board](https://docs.squareline.io/docs/obp) definition for SquareLine Studio.

The \_\_ui_project_name_\_ directory contains the actual custom firmware. The other directory, esp-lcd-3-5-diy_vn_n_n is the properly formed directory that is ***installed by copying to the SquareLine Studio 'boards' directory, under 'Espressif'***

***WARNING*** When any contents of \_\_ui_project_name_\_ are modified, it and its contents need to be manually zipped into a file named esp-lcd-3-5-diy.zip in the esp-lcd-3-5-diy_vn_n_n directory. When the version of the esp-lcd-3-5-diy board support package changes, a new directory must be created incorporating the updated version number.
